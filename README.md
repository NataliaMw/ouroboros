# 🐍 Ouroboros

### any task → the loop it needs

*The snake that eats its own tail — the oldest symbol for a loop that feeds itself until it's whole.*

**The problem:** every coding-agent tool runs the *same fixed loop* for every task — a CSS tweak and a database migration get the identical Planner→Coder→Reviewer pipeline. When the loop's exit condition is too weak for the task, confident-but-wrong code ships. **Ouroboros builds the loop the specific task needs — and a band of agents builds it, then runs it, on one audit trail.**

> **Try it in the browser (zero install):** https://nataliamw.github.io/ouroboros/ — describe *your* task and the loop synthesizes live; scroll to **"Watch a real run"** to see the loop fix real code, gated by real tests.
>
> **Run the real loop yourself — no clone, no keys** (it's published on PyPI):
> ```bash
> pipx run ouroboros-loop try     # runs the loop on a bundled buggy repo, end-to-end, keyless
> pipx run ouroboros-loop demo    # the keyless deterministic loop on two tasks (real subprocess QA)
> ```
> **Point it at YOUR repo + YOUR tests:**
> ```bash
> pipx run ouroboros-loop run --repo ../your-project --test "pytest -q" --file src/thing.py --goal "fix the bug"
> ```
> It runs *your* real test command in a generate→test→revise loop until your tests pass — or hands you a verified failure. No fixtures, your code. (Add `AIMLAPI_API_KEY` to let a model write the fixes.)
>
> **…or as a live Band room of 6 agents working on your repo:**
> ```bash
> python band_repo.py --repo ../your-project --test "pytest -q" --file src/thing.py --goal "fix the bug"
> ```
> Six agents register on Band, connect over WebSocket, and coordinate the loop through `@mention` handoffs — and two of them carry real tools: `@QAEngineer` runs your test command, `@CodeAuthor` patches your file. *Verified live: the room fixed a real bug in a real repo and only finalized once the real tests went green.*

## Why it's useful (not a toy)

Point Ouroboros at a real project and a real test command. It runs the loop on
*your* code: your tests are the exit gate, a model patches the target file using the
**real failure output**, and it only ships a change your own suite accepts. Verified
end-to-end — on a real repo with a real `pytest` bug, the loop failed on a genuine
`AssertionError`, patched the file via AI/ML API, re-ran the suite, and shipped the
fix in one revision. If it can't make your tests pass in the budget, it stops and
hands you a *verified failure* instead of a confident wrong answer.

## The shift this is built on

In June 2026, Addy Osmani and Boris Cherny (the creator of Claude Code) put a name
to where agentic coding is going: **loop engineering**. The skill is no longer
writing the perfect prompt — it's designing the *loop* the agent runs inside:
generate → check → revise, until a real exit condition holds. As Peter Steinberger
put it in a post that hit 6.5M views eleven days before this hackathon's deadline:

> *"You shouldn't be prompting coding agents anymore. You should be designing loops
> that prompt your agents."*

There's a catch nobody's solved yet: **building the loop is still manual, expert
work** — and every coding-agent tool ships the *same* loop for everything. A CSS
tweak and a database migration get the identical Planner→Coder→Reviewer pipeline.
That's vibe coding with extra steps.

**Ouroboros closes that gap.** It's a Band room where agents *engineer the loop for
the specific task*, then *run it* — and pull in the specialists that task needs, on
demand. Loop engineering, done by a band of agents instead of by hand.

And the loop is **real**: the checks don't fake pass/fail from a fixture — they
execute the generated Python in a sandboxed subprocess. A buggy revision genuinely
fails with an `AssertionError`, the loop genuinely bounces, and the fix (written by a
live AI/ML API model when keys are present, or a deterministic fallback when they're
not) only ships once it *actually passes the tests*.

## What it does (in one run)

`python demo.py` feeds the room two different tasks and you watch it build two
different loops:

| | **Task A — bugfix** (pure function) | **Task B — auth change** (high-stakes) |
|---|---|---|
| signature gate | a **repro-test** (fails before, passes after) | an **acceptance-test**, end to end |
| critics | one standing rival reviewer | rival reviewer **+ a SecurityCritic recruited on demand** |
| max revisions | 2 (tight) | 3 |
| human gate | none | **a TechLead must sign before it ships** |

Same room. Same agents. **Different loop** — because the loop is engineered for the
task, not copy-pasted. That difference is the entire point.

## How Band is the coordination layer (not a wrapper)

Three agents, two phases, all on one Band room transcript:

**Phase 1 — design the loop**
- **@LoopArchitect** (Pydantic AI) reads the task and proposes a loop: which checks
  gate it, which critics vote, when it may stop, whether a human must sign.
- **@LoopCritic** (LangGraph) *attacks the proposed exit condition* before any code
  is written — "this is gameable", "this surface needs a security critic" — and
  **recruits that specialist into the room on demand** via Band's add-participant
  tool (`band_add_participant`). This is the most Band-native moment in the system:
  the room decides, at runtime, that it needs a voice nobody added up front, and
  adds it.

**Phase 2 — run the loop**
- **@LoopRunner** (Pydantic AI) executes the assembled loop: generate a revision
  (live via **AI/ML API** when keyed), let every critic (including the recruited one)
  attack it, **really run the required checks in a subprocess** (`qa.py`), and decide
  — stop, revise again, or pause for the human gate. Each revision is a real
  `@mention` bounce in the room, and **@QA posts the real ✅/❌ results** into it.

Take Band out and this is impossible: the loop's *design* and its *execution* live
on the **same audit trail**, so you can read the loop a room built before you trust
the code it produced. The transcript *is* the record of both.

```
user ──"new task"──▶ @LoopArchitect ──proposes loop──▶ @LoopCritic
                                                          │
                              band_add_participant ◀──────┤ (recruits @SecurityCritic
                                                          │  when the task is high-stakes)
                                                          ▼
                                                     @LoopRunner
                                          generate → critics attack → revise → re-check
                                                          │
                                              ⛔ human gate (high-stakes only)
                                                          ▼
                                       verified code + the LoopSpec that produced it
```

## Why it fits the rubric

- **Application of Technology** — Band is load-bearing in two distinct ways: dynamic
  **recruitment** (the room grows its own membership to fit the task) and a visible
  **design-then-execute** handoff chain, all as `@mention` routing on one trail.
- **Originality** — nobody else turns *loop engineering itself* into the multi-agent
  product. Every other Track-2 entry runs a fixed pipeline; Ouroboros **synthesizes
  the pipeline per task**. The thing it generates is the artifact (`LoopSpec`).
- **Business Value** — the failure mode of agentic coding is confident-but-wrong code
  shipping because the loop's exit condition was too weak. Ouroboros makes the loop
  *inspectable and task-appropriate*, with a human gate where the stakes demand one.
- **Presentation** — the whole thesis is one screen: two tasks, two loops, side by
  side, with the difference highlighted. Open the transcript to see it happen.

## Market & business value

**Who has the pain:** every team shipping code with AI agents — and in 2026 that's
most of them. The cost isn't speed, it's trust: a confidently-wrong change that
passed a too-weak loop and made it to production.

- **TAM** — AI coding tools are a multi-billion-dollar category (Copilot, Cursor,
  Claude Code, Devin et al.), and *every* one of them runs a fixed loop. Loop quality
  is the next axis of competition.
- **SAM** — teams running agents against high-stakes surfaces (auth, payments, PII,
  migrations) where a wrong merge is expensive and a human gate is non-negotiable.
  These are exactly the teams that can't use a one-size-fits-all pipeline.
- **Unique selling proposition** — Ouroboros doesn't run a better loop; it **builds
  the right loop per task** and makes it *inspectable* — you read the `LoopSpec` a
  room engineered (its checks, critics, human gate) *before* you trust the code it
  produced. Competitors ship the pipeline; Ouroboros ships the pipeline *plus the
  reasoning for its shape*.
- **Where revenue comes from** — a CI-native control plane: per-seat for the loop
  composer, usage-based for runs in the sandbox, and an enterprise tier for the audit
  trail and human-gate policy (the compliance story regulated teams actually pay for).

## Architecture

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `loopspec.py` | the `Task` and `LoopSpec` — the inspectable loop artifact |
| `qa.py` | **real QA** — executes generated code + tests in a sandboxed subprocess |
| `tasks.py` | concrete tasks with real buggy/fixed code + tests the loop runs |
| `specialists/architect.py` | **@LoopArchitect** — proposes a loop for the task |
| `specialists/critic.py` | **@LoopCritic** — attacks it, recruits specialists on demand |
| `specialists/runner.py` | **@LoopRunner** — runs generate→(real QA)→revise to the exit condition |
| `shared/band_harness.py` | thin Band wrapper + offline `LocalRoom` with `recruit()` |
| `demo.py` | deterministic two-task demo (zero credentials) |
| `band_agents.py` | live Band path (`thenvoi` SDK + credentials) |
| `docs/` | the self-contained web viewer (GitHub Pages) |

## Run it

**Offline, deterministic, no credentials** (this is what's on video):
```bash
python demo.py
```

**Rebuild the web view from a real run:**
```bash
python docs/build_data.py   # regenerates docs/data.json + docs/index.html
```

**Live, on Band** (cross-framework agents over real rooms — *verified working*):
```bash
cp .env.example .env                      # add AIMLAPI_API_KEY + FEATHERLESS_API_KEY
cp agent_config.example.yaml agent_config.yaml   # add Band agent_id/api_key per agent
pip install "band-sdk[pydantic-ai,langgraph]" python-dotenv pyyaml
python band_agents.py                     # connects all 6 agents to Band over WebSocket
```
Then in a Band room, add the six agents and `@mention @LoopArchitect` with a task.
This has been run for real: the six agents register on the Band platform, connect
over WebSocket, and coordinate a task end-to-end through `@mention` handoffs in a
live room — LoopArchitect → LoopCritic → LoopRunner → CodeAuthor → QAEngineer →
RivalReviewer, all on the Band transcript.

## Tech

- **Band** (`band` SDK, v1.0.0) — the coordination layer: rooms, `@mention` routing,
  on-demand recruitment.
- **Cross-framework agents** — Pydantic AI (Architect, Runner, Author, QA) + LangGraph
  (Critic). Six agents, three frameworks, one room.
- **Two LLM providers, used for a reason — not bolted on.** The author/architect/runner
  reason on **AI/ML API** (frontier). The **@RivalReviewer runs a Featherless OSS model
  (Qwen2.5-72B)** — a *different vendor and model*. That split is load-bearing: an
  adversarial review only counts if a genuinely different brain does it, never the same
  model grading its own work. Take Featherless out and the "rival" reviewer is just the
  author talking to itself. (Verified live against `api.featherless.ai`.)
- **No build step for the demo** — the loop's control flow is deterministic, so the
  recording is byte-for-byte reproducible and doesn't depend on a live model.
