"""@QA — the agent that actually runs the tests.

@QA is not a rubber stamp and not a fixture: it takes the candidate code from
@CodeAuthor and EXECUTES the loop's required checks in a sandboxed subprocess
(`qa.py`). It reports the real ✅/❌ back into the room and hands off to
@RivalReviewer, who decides what to do with a passing or failing run. A failure
here is a real interpreter failure — that's what makes the loop honest.
