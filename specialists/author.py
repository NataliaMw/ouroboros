"""@CodeAuthor — writes each revision, then hands the candidate to @QA.

The Author owns code generation only. It does NOT judge its own work — that's the
whole point of the loop. It writes a revision (the first attempt, or a repair that
addresses the exact defects @RivalReviewer bounced back), then @mentions @QA to run
the real checks. Author and reviewer are deliberately different agents (and, live,
different model providers) so the critique is real, not a model grading itself.
