"""Real QA execution — the loop's checks actually run.

This is what makes Loomwright a real loop and not a story about one: a check does
not "decide" pass/fail from a fixture, it WRITES the candidate code and its test to
a temp dir and RUNS them in a fresh Python subprocess. The check passes only if the
interpreter says so. If the generated code is wrong, the test really fails, the loop
really bounces, and the next revision really has to fix it.

No network, no shared interpreter state — each run is an isolated subprocess with a
timeout, so a bad generation can't hang or corrupt the room.
